# HTML-CSS-JS-OwlCarousel-15thMarch2023
Responsive image slider using Owl-Carousel Jquery Pluing Library.
Hi, I'm Vishal and i've created this responsive web layout template.
In order to understand the working mechanism of the "Owl Carousel" (jquery plugin) I've implemented custom css properties to fix some commonly occuring issues.
In this project I've fixed the styling issues of "Navigation Arrows" and "Navigation Dots" inside "Owl Carousel" using custom css.
